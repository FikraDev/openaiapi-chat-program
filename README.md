# openaiapi-chat-program
This program uses the OpenAI API to create a chatbot that can converse with the user. The program prompts the user to enter input, sends that input to the OpenAI API, and displays the response.

## Dependencies

This program depends on the following packages:

- "bufio": Package for reading input from the user. Created by The Go Authors. [Repository](https://github.com/golang/go)
- "context": Package for managing contexts for Go programs. Created by The Go Authors. [Repository](https://github.com/golang/go)
- "fmt": Package for formatting input and output in Go programs. Created by The Go Authors. [Repository](https://github.com/golang/go)
- "os": Package for accessing operating system functionality in Go programs. Created by The Go Authors. [Repository](https://github.com/golang/go)
- "github.com/joho/godotenv": Package for loading environment variables from a .env file. Created by John Barton. [Repository](https://github.com/joho/godotenv)
- "github.com/sashabaranov/go-openai": Package for accessing the OpenAI API. Created by Sasha Baranov. [Repository](https://github.com/sashabaranov/go-openai)

## Usage
To run the program, execute the following command in the terminal:

`go run main.go`

The program will prompt the user to enter input, and then display the response generated by the OpenAI API. This process will repeat ten times.

## Configuration
This program uses an API key to access the OpenAI API. The API key is stored in a `.env file`, which should be located in the same directory as the program. The contents of the `.env` file should be as follows:

`api_key=<your_api_key_here>`

Replace <your_api_key_here> with your actual API key.  To get an API key, head to the openai website and sign up.

## Limitations
This program only allows the user to enter text input. It does not currently support other types of input, such as voice input.

## Acknowledgement
Special thanks to the creators and contributors of these packages for their hard work and dedication to the Go community.
